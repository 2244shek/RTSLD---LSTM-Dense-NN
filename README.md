# RTSLD---LSTM-Dense-NN

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of the RTSLD (Real-Time Sign Language Detection using LSTM and Dense Neural Networks). The goal of this project is to detect and interpret sign language gestures in real-time using a combination of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Dense Neural Networks.
