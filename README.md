# RTSLD---LSTM-Dense-NN

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of the RTSLD (Real-Time Sign Language Detection using LSTM and Dense Neural Networks). The goal of this project is to detect and interpret sign language gestures in real-time using a combination of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Dense Neural Networks.

## Feature
- Data Preprocessing: Load and preprocess sign language video data for model training and evaluation.
- LSTM Model: Implement and train an LSTM model for sequential gesture recognition.
- Dense Neural Network: Implement and train a Dense Neural Network for classification tasks.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the models using various metrics.
- Visualization: Plot and visualize the results for better understanding and analysis.
